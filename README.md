#  Budget Management System  

A full-stack web application I built to simplify personal finance management — helping users stay in control of their income, expenses, and budget goals.

##  Overview  
Managing money can get messy — tracking where it goes, setting limits, and sticking to them isn’t always easy.  
That’s why I created the **Budget Management System**: a clean and responsive platform where users can log their income, track spending habits, and set monthly goals.  

To make it even better, I added **secure login**, **interactive charts**, and a **mobile-friendly design**, so people can keep an eye on their finances anytime, anywhere.

##  Features  

- **User Authentication** – Secure login and registration with **JWT** to keep user data safe.  
- **Income & Expense Tracking** – Add, view, and categorize transactions to spot spending patterns.  
- **Budget Planner** – Set monthly goals and track progress in real-time.  
- **Visual Analytics** – Dynamic charts (pie/bar) make numbers easy to understand at a glance.  
- **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.

##  My Role  

This was a hands-on project where I wore multiple hats:  

- Built backend APIs with **Spring Boot** to power the app’s core features.  
- Implemented **JWT-based authentication** to ensure secure user sessions.  
- Enhanced frontend functionality for better **responsiveness and usability**.  
- Worked with a **5-member Agile team**, practicing version control and smooth API integration.

##  Challenges & Learning  

- **JWT Authentication**: Designing a secure authentication flow gave me deeper insights into **API security**.  
- **Frontend Debugging**: Fixing UI responsiveness issues sharpened my **JavaScript problem-solving**.  
- **Agile Collaboration**: Learned the importance of **team communication and Git best practices**.

##  What’s Next  

I don’t see this as “done.” Here’s how I’d love to improve it further:  

-  Email alerts when users are close to crossing their budget.  
-  Export reports as **PDF or Excel** for easier sharing.  
-  Turn it into a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** for offline access.
