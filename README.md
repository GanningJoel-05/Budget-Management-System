# 💰 Budget Management System  

A full-stack web application I built to simplify personal finance management — helping users stay in control of their income, expenses, and budget goals.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Managing money can get messy — tracking where it goes, setting limits, and sticking to them isn’t always easy.  
That’s why I created the **Budget Management System**: a clean and responsive platform where users can log their income, track spending habits, and set monthly goals.  

To make it even better, I added **secure login**, **interactive charts**, and a **mobile-friendly design**, so people can keep an eye on their finances anytime, anywhere.

## ✨ Features  

- **🔑 User Authentication** – Secure login and registration with **JWT** to keep user data safe.  
- **💵 Income & Expense Tracking** – Add, view, and categorize transactions to spot spending patterns.  
- **📊 Budget Planner** – Set monthly goals and track progress in real-time.  
- **📈 Visual Analytics** – Dynamic charts (pie/bar) make numbers easy to understand at a glance.  
- **📱 Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.

- Enhanced frontend functionality for better **responsiveness and usability**.  
- Worked with a **5-member Agile team**, practicing version control and smooth API integration.

## 🔮 What’s Next  

I don’t see this as “done.” Here’s how I’d love to improve it further:  

- 📧 Email alerts when users are close to crossing their budget.  
- 📑 Export reports as **PDF or Excel** for easier sharing.  
- 📱 Turn it into a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** for offline access.
